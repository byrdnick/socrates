<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are studying whether thoughtful reflection leads people to better answers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We do not assume that your answers have been correct or incorrect.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter your response and confidence about the prior prompt, in the next stage of this study you will write a short essay.
The aim of this exercise is to arrive at the best answer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After writing, you may change your response to the problem if you so choose.</span></p>
